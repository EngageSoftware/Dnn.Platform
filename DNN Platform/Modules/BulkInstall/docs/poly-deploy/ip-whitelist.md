# IP Whitelisting
PolyDeploy makes use of an IP address whitelist as part of security measures to prevent modules from being deployed by unauthorised users. Currently only IPv4 addresses are supported.

In addition to the addresses in the whitelist, localhost or 127.0.0.1 will always pass through.

___Note:___ _IP Whitelisting is still in development and should not be relied upon as a sole security measure._

## Management
The IP address whitelist can be managed through the Management Utility. Using the Management Utility you can add new IP addresses, view the existing whitelist and remove address from the whitelist.
